# Blender File Format Research

In this repository I document the Blender file format in order to learn and as a practical example I aim to get to a point
where I am able to construct a `blend` file in JavaScript which contains a scene with a few basic meshes, previewed in a
WebGL canvas and when stored, can be opened by Blender and renders the same scene.

I am going to use the following sources which are top search results and look authoritative, quality enough:

- https://archive.blender.org/wiki/index.php/Dev:Source/Architecture/File_Format/
- https://blender.stackexchange.com/q/23584/68286 and the contained links
- https://github.com/fschutt/mystery-of-the-blend-backup
- https://developer.blender.org/diffusion/B/browse/master/doc/blender_file_format
- https://github.com/ldo/blendhack
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)#File_format
- https://formats.kaitai.io/blender_blend/index.html

## To-Do

### Link the repository where I run blender in GitHub Actions

### Document the Blender file format

### Create a web app with a WebGL scene renderer containing basic shapes (sphere, cube, text, maybe 2D shapes)

### Implement persisting the user-defined scene as a Bledner `blend` file

### Implement parsing using JavaScript
